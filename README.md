# Java Rewards ☕️

## Welcome!
Java Rewards is a loyalty rewards app designed for independent coffee shops.
Businesses can sign up to the app and create a profile. Customers can sign up and claim a free coffee after they have purchased 7 coffees at any businesses that are signed up to Java Rewards. The aim is to help promote independent coffee shops and allow them to build a loyal customer base.

## Tech Stack

We built the app with React Native, Typescript, Expo Go and Firebase.
It uses an API that we built with Node, Express, Typescript and MongoDB.

Repo for API: https://github.com/Liam-Tomlinson/Java-Rewards-BackEnd

## Functionality
### Business
- Create an account
- Receive orders through the app
- Ability to scan a customer's QR code to update the number of coffees they have purchased
- A profile page where the shop description, menu and offers can be updated. Also a business can view statistics based on data about their customers such as the number of orders by month.

### Customer
- Create an account
- A map showing the nearest coffee shops that use Java Rewards
- A list of the nearest coffee shops
- View a coffee shop profile
- Order from a coffee shop with the option to pay through the app or in store
- View current offers
- A unique QR code to be scanned by the business upon purchase of a coffee
- A profile page that shows a progress bar for the number of coffees left to buy before getting a free coffee. Customers can also view their previous orders they have made through the app.
